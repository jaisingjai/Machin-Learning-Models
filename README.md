# 01-- Linear Regression 
Ames, Iowa: Alternative to the Boston Housing Data as an End of Semester Regression Project predicting House Price.

# 02-- Logistic Regression
This database contains 14 physical attributes based on physical testing of a patient. Blood samples are taken and the patient also conducts a brief exercise test. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer (0 for no presence, 1 for presence). In general, to confirm 100% if a patient has heart disease can be quite an invasive process, so if we can create a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of heart disease, we can help avoid expensive and invasive procedures.

# 03-- K -Nearest Neighbor 
### Detecting a Rock or a Mine

Sonar (sound navigation ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.
The data set contains the response metrics for 60 separate sonar frequencies sent out against a known mine field (and known rocks). These frequencies are then labeled with the known object they were beaming the sound at (either a rock or a mine). 
Our main goal is to create a machine learning model capable of detecting the difference between a rock or a mine based on the response of the 60 separate sonar frequencies.

# 04-- Support Vector Machine,
We will be using the same dataset through our discussions on classification with tree-methods (Decision Tree,Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Trees) in order to compare performance metrics across these related models.
We will work with the "Palmer Penguins" dataset, as it is simple enough to help us fully understand how changing hyperparameters can change classification results.
Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

# 07-- Adaboost 
# 08-- Graidient Boost
This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

## Make sure to review the introduction video to understand the 3 ways of approaching this project exercise!

----

**Ways to approach the project:**
   1. Open a new notebook, read in the data, and then analyze and visualize whatever you want, then create a predictive model.
   2. Use this notebook as a general guide, completing the tasks in bold shown below.
   3. Skip to the solutions notebook and video, and treat project at a more relaxing code along walkthrough lecture series.

# 11-- K -Means 
Goal:
Gain insights into similarity between countries and regions of the world by experimenting with different cluster amounts. What do these clusters represent? Note: There is no 100% right answer, make sure to watch the video for thoughts.

Data Set Information from Original Authors:¬∂
We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.

We use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends  ùë•
  and  ùë¶
  tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds.

These writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution. Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes. If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this.
